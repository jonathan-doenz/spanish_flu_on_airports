# Would humanity survive a Spanish flu pandemic today?

This is the research question we tackle here in the context of the project of 2019-2020's EPFL course
 _A Network Tour of Data Science_ (EE-558).

 We first construct and analyze the graph of the world's aerial network. 
 Then we run simulations of a Spanish flu epidemic on it and compare different
 control strategies.
